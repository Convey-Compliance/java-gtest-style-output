# java-gtest-style-output
GoogleTest style console output for Java

There's no jar file for this. You get source code. If you want a jar, feel free to build it yourself.

To use this directly from source:

1. Clone this somewhere in your main project repo
3. Position the command line prompt in the root of the your test folder in your project
2. Create a softlink like this mklink /D GTestStyleOutput ..\ <your submodules location> \java-gtest-style-output\src\GTestStyleOutput

That's it.
